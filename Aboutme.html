        <p>Mamadou Adama Diallo, I spent my formative university years immersing myself in the complex world of sociology and specialized in the sociology of organizations. 
            Enrolled in a prestigious graduate program, I dedicated myself to understanding the complexities of social behavior, institutions, and structures.
            During my graduate studies, I became deeply engaged in classical sociological theories and contemporary studies, often connecting the two in its analyses.
             I have participated in numerous field studies, where I applied qualitative methods to collect data and better understand community interactions and social norms.</p>
